# Inverse Ising

This repository contains Julia implementation of RISE, logRISE and RPLE algorithms for the inverse Ising problem.

## Prerequisites

For running the code, you need to have Julia installed on your computer, as well as the Julia packages JuMP, Ipopt and StatsBase packages. The code includes `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files that can be used to configure a Julia environment that the code was tested with.

## Running

Specify desired parameters and file names in the arguments.csv file: reconstruction method (RISE, logRISE, RPLE), regularization coefficient c_lambda, symmetrization of reconstructed couplings (Y, N), name of the input sample file, name of the output parameters file.

Then run `Inverse_Ising.jl` in the command line:

```
julia Inverse_Ising.jl RISE 0.0 N synthetic_example/output_samples.csv output_model.csv
```

The input csv sample file should be in the histogram form, where each line is in the format "number of time a configuration has been sampled, configuration". The output file of reconstructed parameters has the form of a csv matrix that includes couplings (as off-diagonal entries) and magnetic fields (as diagonal entries).

For small systems (e.g. N<=25), samples can be exhaustively generated with `Gibbs_Sampler.jl`:

```
julia Gibbs_Sampler.jl input_adjacency.csv <num_samples> output_samples.csv
```

See above for the formats of the adjacency matrix (containing parameters) and of the output file (containing samples in the histogram representation). A small synthetic example of input and output files is provided in the folder "synthetic_example".

## D-Wave data set

The real data set generated on the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer "Ising" at Los Alamos National Laboratory and used in the paper for illustration is available in the folder "data_dwave".
